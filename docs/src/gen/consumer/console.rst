Console
=======

This consumer reads from stdin or a named pipe. A message is generated after
each newline character.




Metadata
--------

**pipe**

  name of the pipe the message was received on (set)
  
  

Parameters
----------

**Pipe** (default: stdin)

  Defines the pipe to read from. This can be "stdin" or the path
  to a named pipe. If the named pipe is not existing it will be creared.
  By default this paramater is set to "stdin".
  
  

**Permissions** (default: 0644)

  Accepts an octal number string containing the unix file
  permissions used when creating a named pipe.
  By default this paramater is set to "0664".
  
  

**ExitOnEOF** (default: true)

  Can be set to true to trigger an exit signal if the pipe is closed
  i.e. when EOF is detected.
  By default this paramater is set to "true".
  
  

Parameters (from SimpleConsumer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**

  switches the consumer on or off.
  By default this parameter is set to true.
  
  

**Streams**

  Defines a list of streams a consumer will send to. This parameter
  is mandatory. When using "*" messages will be sent only to the internal "*"
  stream. It will NOT send messages to all streams.
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

**ShutdownTimeoutMs** (default: 1000, unit: ms)

  Defines the maximum time in milliseconds a consumer is
  allowed to take to shut down. After this timeout the consumer is always
  considered to have shut down.
  By default this parameter is set to 1000.
  
  

**Modulators**

  Defines a list of modulators to be applied to a message before
  it is sent to the list of streams. If a modulator specifies a stream, the
  message is only sent to that specific stream. A message is saved as original
  after all modulators have been applied.
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

**ModulatorRoutines**

  Defines the number of go routines reserved for
  modulating messages. Setting this parameter to 0 will use as many go routines
  as the specific consumer plugin is using for fetching data. Any other value
  will force the given number fo go routines to be used.
  By default this parameter is set to 0
  
  

**ModulatorQueueSize**

  Defines the size of the channel used to buffer messages
  before they are fetched by the next free modulator go routine. If the
  ModulatorRoutines parameter is set to 0 this parameter is ignored.
  By default this parameter is set to 1024.
  
  

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: yaml

	This config reads data from stdin e.g. when starting gollum via unix pipe.
