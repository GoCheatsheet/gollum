Console
=======================================================================

 This consumer reads from stdin.
A message is generated after each newline character.


Parameters
----------

**Console**
  Console defines the pipe to read from.
  This can be "stdin" or the name of a named pipe that is created if not existing.
  The default is "stdin".

**Permissions**
  Permissions accepts an octal number string that contains the unix file permissions used when creating a named pipe.
  By default this is set to "0664".

**ExitOnEOF**
  ExitOnEOF can be set to true to trigger an exit signal if StdIn is closed (e.g. when a pipe is closed).
  This is set to false by default.

Parameters (from SimpleConsumer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**
  Enable switches the consumer on or off.
  By default this value is set to true.

**ID**
  ID allows this consumer to be found by other plugins by name.
  By default this is set to "" which does not register this consumer.

**Router**
  Router contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the message channels this consumer will produce.
  By default this is set to "*" which means only producers set to consume "all routers" will get these messages.

**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
  ShutdownTimeoutMs sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect various timeouts during shutdown.
  By default this is set to 1 second.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: yaml

	- "consumer.Console":
	    Console: "stdin"
	    Permissions: "0664"
	    ExitOnEOF: false
