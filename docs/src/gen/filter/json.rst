JSON
====================================================================

This plugin allows filtering of JSON messages by looking at certain fields.
Note that this filter is quite expensive due to JSON marshaling and regexp testing of every message passing through it.


Parameters
----------

**FilterReject**
  FilterReject defines fields that will cause a message to be rejected if the given regular expression matches.
  Rejects are checked before Accepts.
  Field paths can be defined in a format accepted by tgo.MarshalMap.Path.

**FilterAccept**
  FilterAccept defines fields that will cause a message to be rejected if the given regular expression does not match.
  Field paths can be defined in a format accepted by tgo.MarshalMap.Path.

Parameters (from SimpleFilter)
------------------------------

**FilteredStream**
  FilteredStream defines a stream where filtered messages get sent to.
  You can disable this behavior by setting "".
  Set to "" by default.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: yaml

	- filter.JSON:
	        Reject:
	            "command" : "state\d\..*"
	        Accept:
	            "args/results[0]value" : "true"
	            "args/results[1]" : "true"
