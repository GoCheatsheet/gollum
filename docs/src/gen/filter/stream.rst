Stream
======

This plugin filters messages by stream based on a black and a whitelist.
The blacklist is checked first.




Parameters
----------

**Block**

  Sets a list of streams that are blocked. If a message's
  stream is not in that list, the OnlyStreams list is tested.
  By default this parameter is set to "empty".
  
  

**Only**

  Sets a list of streams that may pass. Messages from streams
  that are not in this list are blocked unless the list is empty.
  By default this parameter is set to "empty".
  
  

Parameters (from core.SimpleFilter)
-----------------------------------

**FilteredStream**

  This value defines a stream where filtered messages get sent to.
  You can disable this behavior by setting "".
  By default this parameter is set to "".
