Benchmark
=========

This producer is meant to give more meaningful results in benchmark
situations than producer.Null as it is based on a buffered producers.




Parameters (from BufferedProducer)
----------------------------------

**Channel**

  This value defines the capacity of the message buffer.
  By default this parameter is set to "8192".
  
  

**ChannelTimeoutMs** (default: 0, unit: ms)

  This value defines a timeout for each message before the message will discarded.
  You can set this parameter to "0" for disabling the timeout.
  By default this parameter is set to "0".
  
  

Parameters (from DirectProducer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**

  switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.
  
  

**ID**

  allows this producer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
  is set to "" which does not register this producer.
  
  

**ShutdownTimeoutMs**

  sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
  a blocking producer during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
  Decreasing this value may lead to lost messages during shutdown. Increasing
  this value will increase shutdown time.
  
  

**Streams**

  contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
  message channels this producer will consume. By default this is set to "*"
  which means "listen to all routers but the internal".
  
  

**FallbackStream**

  defines the stream used for messages that are sent to the fallback after
  a timeout (see ChannelTimeoutMs). By default this is _DROPPED_.
  
  

**Modulators**

  sets formatter and filter to use. Each formatter has its own set of options
  which can be set here, too. By default this is set to format.Forward.
  Each producer decides if and when to use a Formatter.
