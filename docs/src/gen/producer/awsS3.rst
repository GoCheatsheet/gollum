AwsS3
=====

This producer sends messages to Amazon S3.
Each "file" use a configurable batch and sends the content by a multipart upload to s3.
This principle avoid temporary storage on disk.

Please keep in mind that Amazon S3 do not support appending to existing objects. Because of that a rotation is
mandatory in this producer.




Parameters
----------

**Bucket**

  Your S3 bucket where you want to upload.
  
  

**File** (default: gollum_*.log)

  This value is used as a base file pattern for you final file names.
  The " * " will parsed to the active stream name.
  By default this parameter is set to "gollum_*.log"
  
  

Parameters (from DirectProducer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**

  switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.
  
  

**FallbackStream**

  defines the stream used for messages that are sent to the fallback after
  a timeout (see ChannelTimeoutMs). By default this is _DROPPED_.
  
  

**ID**

  allows this producer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
  is set to "" which does not register this producer.
  
  

**Modulators**

  sets formatter and filter to use. Each formatter has its own set of options
  which can be set here, too. By default this is set to format.Forward.
  Each producer decides if and when to use a Formatter.
  
  

**ShutdownTimeoutMs**

  sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
  a blocking producer during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
  Decreasing this value may lead to lost messages during shutdown. Increasing
  this value will increase shutdown time.
  
  

**Streams**

  contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
  message channels this producer will consume. By default this is set to "*"
  which means "listen to all routers but the internal".

**Credential/Secret**

  is used for "static" type and is used as the SecretAccessKey
  
  

**Credential/Token**

  is used for "static" type and is used as the SessionToken
  
  

**Credential/Type** (default: none)

  This value defines the credentials that are to be used when

  * none: Use a anonymous login to aws
  See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/credentials/#Credentials for more information
  By default this parameter is set to "none".

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: yaml

	This example will send all received message from all stream to S3
	and create a own file for each stream:
	
	 S3Out:
	   Type: producer.AwsS3
	   Credential:
	     Type: shared
	     File: /Users/<USERNAME>/.aws/credentials
	     Profile: default
	   Region: eu-west-1
	   Bucket: gollum-s3-test
	   Streams:
	     - "*"
	   Batch:
	     TimeoutSec: 60
	     MaxCount: 1000
	     FlushCount: 500
	     FlushTimeoutSec: 0
	   Rotation:
	     Timestamp: 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00
	     TimeoutMin: 1
	     SizeMB: 20
	   Modulators:
	     - format.Envelope:
	       Postfix: "\n"
