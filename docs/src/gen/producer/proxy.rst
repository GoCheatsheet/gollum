Proxy
=====

This producer is compatible to consumer.proxy.
Responses to messages sent to the given address are sent back to the original
consumer of it is a compatible message source. As with consumer.proxy the
returned messages are partitioned by common message length algorithms.




Parameters
----------

**Address**

  This value stores the identifier to connect to.
  This can either be any ip address and port like "localhost:5880" or a file
  like "unix:///var/gollum.Proxy".
  By default this parameter is set to ":5880".
  
  

**ConnectionBufferSizeKB** (default: 1024, unit: mb)

  This value sets the connection buffer size in KB.
  This also defines the size of the buffer used by the message parser.
  By default this parameter is set to "1024".
  
  

**Delimiter**

  This value defines the delimiter used by the text and delimiter partitioner.
  By default this parameter is set to "\n".
  
  

**Offset**

  This value defines the offset used by the binary and text partitioner.
  This setting is ignored by the fixed partitioner.
  By default this paramter is set to "0".
  
  

**Partitioner**

  This value defines the algorithm used to read messages from the stream.
  The messages will be sent as a whole, no cropping or removal will take place.
  By default this parameter is set to "delimiter".
  
  * delimiter: separates messages by looking for a delimiter string. The
  
  delimiter is included into the left hand message.
  
  * ascii: reads an ASCII encoded number at a given offset until a given
  
  delimiter is found.
  
  * binary: reads a binary number at a given offset and size
  
  * binary_le: is an alias for "binary"
  
  * binary_be: is the same as "binary" but uses big endian encoding
  
  * fixed: assumes fixed size messages
  
  

**Size**

  This value defines the size in bytes used by the binary or fixed partitioner.
  For `binary` this can be set to 1,2,4 or 8,  for `fixed` this defines the size of a message.
  BY default this paramter is set to "4" for `binary` or "1" for `fixed` partitioner.
  
  

**TimeoutSec** (default: 1, unit: sec)

  This value defines the maximum time in seconds a client is allowed to take
  for a response.
  By default this parameter is set to "1".
  
  

Parameters (from BufferedProducer)
----------------------------------

**Channel**

  This value defines the capacity of the message buffer.
  By default this parameter is set to "8192".
  
  

**ChannelTimeoutMs** (default: 0, unit: ms)

  This value defines a timeout for each message before the message will discarded.
  You can set this parameter to "0" for disabling the timeout.
  By default this parameter is set to "0".
  
  

Parameters (from DirectProducer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**

  switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.
  
  

**FallbackStream**

  defines the stream used for messages that are sent to the fallback after
  a timeout (see ChannelTimeoutMs). By default this is _DROPPED_.
  
  

**ID**

  allows this producer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
  is set to "" which does not register this producer.
  
  

**Modulators**

  sets formatter and filter to use. Each formatter has its own set of options
  which can be set here, too. By default this is set to format.Forward.
  Each producer decides if and when to use a Formatter.
  
  

**ShutdownTimeoutMs**

  sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
  a blocking producer during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
  Decreasing this value may lead to lost messages during shutdown. Increasing
  this value will increase shutdown time.
  
  

**Streams**

  contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
  message channels this producer will consume. By default this is set to "*"
  which means "listen to all routers but the internal".
  
  

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: yaml

	This example will send 64bit length encoded data on TCP port 5880.
	
	 proxyOut:
	   Type: producer.Proxy
	   Address: ":5880"
	   Partitioner: binary
	   Size: 8
