Scribe
======

This producer allows sending messages to Facebook's scribe service.




Parameters
----------

**Address**

  Defines the host and port of a scrive endpoint.
  By default this parameter is set to "localhost:1463".
  
  

**ConnectionBufferSizeKB** (default: 1024, unit: kb)

  Sets the connection socket buffer size in KB.
  By default this parameter is set to 1024.
  
  

**HeartBeatIntervalSec** (default: 5, unit: sec)

  Defines the interval in seconds used to query scribe
  for status updates.
  By default this parameter is set to 1.
  
  

**WindowSize** (default: 2048)

  Defines the maximum number of messages send to scribe in one
  call. The WindowSize will reduce when scribe is returing "try later" to
  reduce load on the scribe server. It will slowly rise again for each
  successful write until WindowSize is reached again.
  By default this parameter is set to 2048.
  
  

**ConnectionTimeoutSec** (default: 5, unit: sec)

  Defines the time in seconds after which a connection
  timeout is assumed. This can happen during writes or status reads.
  By default this parameter is set to 5.
  
  

**Category**

  Maps a stream to a scribe category. You can define the wildcard
  stream (*) here, too. When set, all streams that do not have a specific
  mapping will go to this category (including reserved streams like _GOLLUM_).
  If no category mappings are set the stream name is used as category.
  By default this parameter is set to an empty list.
  
  

Parameters (from core.BatchedProducer)
--------------------------------------

**Batch/MaxCount** (default: 8192)

  Defines the maximum number of messages per batch. If this
  limit is reached a flush is always triggered.
  By default this parameter is set to 8192.
  
  

**Batch/FlushCount** (default: 4096)

  Defines the minimum number of messages required to flush
  a batch. If this limit is reached a flush might be triggered.
  By default this parameter is set to 4096.
  
  

**Batch/TimeoutSec** (default: 5, unit: sec)

  Defines the maximum time in seconds messages can stay in
  the internal buffer before being flushed.
  By default this parameter is set to 5.
