Spooling
========


The Spooling producer buffers messages and sends them again to the previous
stream stored in the message. This means the message must have been routed
at least once before reaching the spooling producer. If the previous and
current stream is identical the message is sent to the fallback.
The Formatter configuration value is forced to "format.Serialize" and
cannot be changed.




Parameters
----------

**Path**
sets the output directory for spooling files. Spooling files will
Files will be stored as "<path>/<stream>/<number>.spl". By default this is
set to "/var/run/gollum/spooling".


**BatchMaxCount**
defines the maximum number of messages stored in memory before
a write to file is triggered. Set to 100 by default.


**BatchTimeoutSec**
defines the maximum number of seconds to wait after the last
message arrived before a batch is flushed automatically. By default this is
set to 5.


**MaxFileSizeMB**
sets the size in MB when a spooling file is rotated. Reading
will start only after a file is rotated. Set to 512 MB by default.


**MaxFileAgeMin**
defines the time in minutes after a spooling file is rotated.
Reading will start only after a file is rotated. This setting divided by two
will be used to define the wait time for reading, too.
Set to 1 minute by default.


**BufferSizeByte**
defines the initial size of the buffer that is used to parse
messages from a spool file. If a message is larger than this size, the buffer
will be resized. By default this is set to 8192.


**RespoolDelaySec**
sets the number of seconds to wait before trying to load
existing spool files after a restart. This is useful for configurations that
contain dynamic streams. By default this is set to 10.


**MaxMessagesSec**
sets the maximum number of messages that can be respooled per
second. By default this is set to 100. Setting this value to 0 will cause
respooling to work as fast as possible.


**RevertStreamOnDrop**
can be used to revert the message stream before dropping
the message. This can be useful if you e.g. want to write messages that
could not be spooled to stream separated files on disk. Set to false by
default.


Parameters (from BufferedProducer)
----------------------------------

**Enable**
switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.


**ID**
allows this producer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
is set to "" which does not register this producer.


**Channel**
sets the size of the channel used to communicate messages. By default
this value is set to 8192.


**ChannelTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds for messages to wait if this
producer's queue is full.
A timeout of -1 or lower will send the message the the fallback without notice.
A timeout of 0 will block until the queue is free. This is the default.
A timeout of 1 or higher will wait x milliseconds for the queues to become
available again. If this does not happen, the message will be send to the
retry channel.


**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
a blocking producer during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
Decreasing this value may lead to lost messages during shutdown. Increasing
this value will increase shutdown time.


**Router**
contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
message channels this producer will consume. By default this is set to "*"
which means "listen to all routers but the internal".


**FallbackStream**
defines the stream used for messages that are sent to the fallback after
a timeout (see ChannelTimeoutMs). By default this is _DROPPED_.


**Formatter**
sets a formatter to use. Each formatter has its own set of options
which can be set here, too. By default this is set to format.Forward.
Each producer decides if and when to use a Formatter.


**Filter**
sets a filter that is applied before formatting, i.e. before a message
is send to the message queue. If a producer requires filtering after
formatting it has to define a separate filter as the producer decides if
and where to format.


Parameters (from SimpleProducer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**
switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.


**ID**
allows this producer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
is set to "" which does not register this producer.


**Channel**
sets the size of the channel used to communicate messages. By default
this value is set to 8192.


**ChannelTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds for messages to wait if this
producer's queue is full.
A timeout of -1 or lower will try the fallback route without notice.
A timeout of 0 will block until the queue is free. This is the default.
A timeout of 1 or higher will wait x milliseconds for the queues to become
available again. If this does not happen, the message will be send to the
retry channel.


**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
a blocking producer during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
Decreasing this value may lead to lost messages during shutdown. Increasing
this value will increase shutdown time.


**Router**
contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
message channels this producer will consume. By default this is set to "*"
which means "listen to all routers but the internal".


**FallbackStream**
defines the stream used for messages that cannot be delivered
e.g. after a timeout (see ChannelTimeoutMs). By default this is "".


**Formatter**
sets a formatter to use. Each formatter has its own set of options
which can be set here, too. By default this is set to format.Forward.
Each producer decides if and when to use a Formatter.


**Filter**
sets a filter that is applied before formatting, i.e. before a message
is send to the message queue. If a producer requires filtering after
formatting it has to define a separate filter as the producer decides if
and where to format.
