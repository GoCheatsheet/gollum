Spooling
========

The Spooling producer buffers messages and sends them again to the previous
stream stored in the message. This means the message must have been routed
at least once before reaching the spooling producer. If the previous and
current stream is identical the message is sent to the fallback.
The Formatter configuration value is forced to "format.Serialize" and
cannot be changed.

Configuration example

 - "producer.Spooling":
   Path: "/var/run/gollum/spooling"
   BatchMaxCount: 100
   BatchTimeoutSec: 5
   MaxFileSizeMB: 512
   MaxFileAgeMin: 1
   MessageSizeByte: 8192
   RespoolDelaySec: 10
   MaxMessagesSec: 100
   RevertStreamOnDrop: false

Path sets the output directory for spooling files. Spooling files will
Files will be stored as "<path>/<stream>/<number>.spl". By default this is
set to "/var/run/gollum/spooling".

BatchMaxCount defines the maximum number of messages stored in memory before
a write to file is triggered. Set to 100 by default.

BatchTimeoutSec defines the maximum number of seconds to wait after the last
message arrived before a batch is flushed automatically. By default this is
set to 5.

MaxFileSizeMB sets the size in MB when a spooling file is rotated. Reading
will start only after a file is rotated. Set to 512 MB by default.

MaxFileAgeMin defines the time in minutes after a spooling file is rotated.
Reading will start only after a file is rotated. This setting divided by two
will be used to define the wait time for reading, too.
Set to 1 minute by default.

BufferSizeByte defines the initial size of the buffer that is used to parse
messages from a spool file. If a message is larger than this size, the buffer
will be resized. By default this is set to 8192.

RespoolDelaySec sets the number of seconds to wait before trying to load
existing spool files after a restart. This is useful for configurations that
contain dynamic streams. By default this is set to 10.

MaxMessagesSec sets the maximum number of messages that can be respooled per
second. By default this is set to 100. Setting this value to 0 will cause
respooling to work as fast as possible.

RevertStreamOnDrop can be used to revert the message stream before dropping
the message. This can be useful if you e.g. want to write messages that
could not be spooled to stream separated files on disk. Set to false by
default.

Parameters (from BufferedProducer)
----------------------------------

**Channel**

  This value defines the capacity of the message buffer.
  By default this parameter is set to "8192".
  
  

**ChannelTimeoutMs** (default: 0, unit: ms)

  This value defines a timeout for each message before the message will discarded.
  You can set this parameter to "0" for disabling the timeout.
  By default this parameter is set to "0".
  
  

Parameters (from DirectProducer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**

  switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.
  
  

**FallbackStream**

  defines the stream used for messages that are sent to the fallback after
  a timeout (see ChannelTimeoutMs). By default this is _DROPPED_.
  
  

**ID**

  allows this producer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
  is set to "" which does not register this producer.
  
  

**Modulators**

  sets formatter and filter to use. Each formatter has its own set of options
  which can be set here, too. By default this is set to format.Forward.
  Each producer decides if and when to use a Formatter.
  
  

**ShutdownTimeoutMs**

  sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
  a blocking producer during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
  Decreasing this value may lead to lost messages during shutdown. Increasing
  this value will increase shutdown time.
  
  

**Streams**

  contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
  message channels this producer will consume. By default this is set to "*"
  which means "listen to all routers but the internal".
  
  

Parameters (from components.RotateConfig)
-----------------------------------------

**Rotation/At**

  This value defines a specific time for rotation in hh:mm format.
  By default this parameter is set to "".
  
  

**Rotation/AtHour** (default: -1)

  (no documentation available)
  

**Rotation/AtMin** (default: -1)

  (no documentation available)
  

**Rotation/Compress** (default: false)

  This value defines if a rotated logfile is to be gzip compressed or not.
  By default this parameter is set to "false".
  
  

**Rotation/Enable** (default: false)

  If this value is set to "true" the logs will rotate after reaching certain thresholds.
  By default this parameter is set to "false".
  
  

**Rotation/SizeMB** (default: 1024, unit: mb)

  This value defines the maximum file size in MB that triggers a file rotate.
  Files can get bigger than this size.
  By default this parameter is set to "1024".
  
  

**Rotation/TimeoutMin** (default: 1440, unit: min)

  This value defines a timeout in minutes that will cause the logs to
  rotate. Can be set in parallel with RotateSizeMB.
  By default this parameter is set to "1440".
  
  

**Rotation/Timestamp** (default: 2006-01-02_15)

  This value sets the timestamp added to the filename when file rotation
  is enabled. The format is based on Go's time.Format function.
  By default this parameter is to to "2006-01-02_15".
  
  

**Rotation/ZeroPadding** (default: 0)

  This value sets the number of leading zeros when rotating files with
  an existing name. Setting this setting to 0 won't add zeros, every other
  number defines the number of leading zeros to be used.
  By default this parameter is set to "0".
