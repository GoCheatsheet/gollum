AwsKinesis
==========

This producer sends data to an AWS kinesis stream.
Configuration example




Parameters
----------

**StreamMapping**

  This value defines a translation from gollum stream to kinesis stream
  name. If no mapping is given the gollum stream name is used as kinesis stream name.
  By default this parameter is set to "empty"
  
  

**RecordMaxMessages** (default: 1)

  This value defines the maximum number of messages to join into
  a kinesis record.
  By default this parameter is set to "500".
  
  

**RecordMessageDelimiter** (default: \n)

  This value defines the string to delimit messages within
  a kinesis record.
  By default this parameter is set to "\n".
  
  

**SendTimeframeMs** (default: 1000, unit: ms)

  This value defines the timeframe in milliseconds in which a second
  batch send can be triggered.
  By default this parameter is set to "1000".
  
  

Parameters (from BatchedProducer)
---------------------------------

**Batch/MaxCount** (default: 8192)

  Defines the maximum number of messages per batch. If this
  limit is reached a flush is always triggered.
  By default this parameter is set to 8192.
  
  

**Batch/FlushCount** (default: 4096)

  Defines the minimum number of messages required to flush
  a batch. If this limit is reached a flush might be triggered.
  By default this parameter is set to 4096.
  
  

**Batch/TimeoutSec** (default: 5, unit: sec)

  Defines the maximum time in seconds messages can stay in
  the internal buffer before being flushed.
  By default this parameter is set to 5.
  
  

Parameters (from DirectProducer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**

  switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.
  
  

**ID**

  allows this producer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
  is set to "" which does not register this producer.
  
  

**ShutdownTimeoutMs**

  sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
  a blocking producer during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
  Decreasing this value may lead to lost messages during shutdown. Increasing
  this value will increase shutdown time.
  
  

**Streams**

  contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
  message channels this producer will consume. By default this is set to "*"
  which means "listen to all routers but the internal".
  
  

**FallbackStream**

  defines the stream used for messages that are sent to the fallback after
  a timeout (see ChannelTimeoutMs). By default this is _DROPPED_.
  
  

**Modulators**

  sets formatter and filter to use. Each formatter has its own set of options
  which can be set here, too. By default this is set to format.Forward.
  Each producer decides if and when to use a Formatter.
  
  

Parameters (from components.AwsMultiClient)
-------------------------------------------

**Region** (default: us-east-1)

  This value defines the used aws region.
  By default this is set to "us-east-1"
  
  

**Endpoint**

  This value defines the used aws api endpoint. If no endpoint is set
  the client needs to set the right endpoint for the used region.
  By default this is set to "".
  
  

Parameters (from components.AwsCredentials)
-------------------------------------------

**Credential/Type** (default: none)

  This value defines the credentials that are to be used when
  connecting to aws. Available values are listed below. See
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/credentials/#Credentials
  for more information.
  
  

  **environment**

    Retrieves credentials from the environment variables of
    the running process
    
    

  **static**

    Retrieves credentials value for individual credential fields
    
    

  **shared**

    Retrieves credentials from the current user's home directory
    
    

  **none**

    Use a anonymous login to aws
    
    

**Credential/Id**

  is used for "static" type and is used as the AccessKeyID
  
  

**Credential/Token**

  is used for "static" type and is used as the SessionToken
  
  

**Credential/Secret**

  is used for "static" type and is used as the SecretAccessKey
  
  

**Credential/File**

  is used for "shared" type and is used as the path to your
  shared Credentials file (~/.aws/credentials)
  
  

**Credential/Profile** (default: default)

  is used for "shared" type and is used for the profile
  
  

**Credential/AssumeRole**

  This value is used to assume an IAM role using.
  By default this is set to "".
