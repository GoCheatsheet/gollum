Socket
======

The socket producer connects to a service over a TCP, UDP or unix domain
socket based connection.




Parameters
----------

**Enable** (default: true)

  Switches this plugin on or off.
  

**Address**

  This value stores the identifier to connect to.
  This can either be any ip address and port like "localhost:5880" or a file
  like "unix:///var/gollum.socket".
  By default this parameter is set to ":5880".
  
  

**ConnectionBufferSizeKB** (default: 1024, unit: kb)

  This value sets the connection buffer size in KB.
  By default this parameter is set to "1024".
  
  

**Batch/MaxCount** (default: 8192)

  This value defines the maximum number of messages that can be buffered
  before a flush is mandatory. If the buffer is full and a flush is still
  underway or cannot be triggered out of other reasons, the producer will block.
  By default this parameter is set to "8192".
  
  

**Batch/FlushCount** (default: 4096)

  This value defines the number of messages to be buffered before they are
  written to disk. This setting is clamped to BatchMaxCount.
  By default this parameter is set to "Batch/MaxCount / 2".
  Batch/TimeoutSec: This value defines the maximum number of seconds to wait after the last
  message arrived before a batch is flushed automatically.
  By default this parameter is set to "5".
  
  

**Acknowledge**

  This value can be set to a non-empty value to expect the given string as a
  response from the server after a batch has been sent.
  If Acknowledge is enabled and a IP-Address is given to Address, TCP is used
  to open the connection, otherwise UDP is used.
  By default this parameter is set to "".
  
  

**AckTimeoutMs** (default: 2000, unit: ms)

  This value defines the time in milliseconds to wait for a response from the
  server. After this timeout the send is marked as failed.
  By default this parameter is set to "2000".
  
  

**Batch/TimeoutSec** (default: 5, unit: sec)

  (no documentation available)
  

Parameters (from core.BufferedProducer)
---------------------------------------

**Channel**

  This value defines the capacity of the message buffer.
  By default this parameter is set to "8192".
  
  

**ChannelTimeoutMs** (default: 0, unit: ms)

  This value defines a timeout for each message before the message will discarded.
  You can set this parameter to "0" for disabling the timeout.
  By default this parameter is set to "0".
  
  

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: yaml

	This example starts a socket producer on localhost port 5880:
	
	 SocketOut:
	   Type: producer.Socket
	   Address: ":5880"
	   Batch
	     MaxCount: 1024
	     FlushCount: 512
	     TimeoutSec: 3
	   AckTimeoutMs: 1000
