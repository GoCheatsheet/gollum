InfluxDB
========

This producer writes data to an influxDB endpoint. Data is not converted to
the correct influxDB format automatically. Proper formatting might be
required.




Parameters
----------

**Version**

  Defines the InfluxDB protocol version to use. This can either be
  80-89 for 0.8.x, 90 for 0.9.0 or 91-100 for 0.9.1 or later.
  Be default this parameter is set to 100.
  
  

**Host**

  Defines the host (and port) of the InfluxDB master.
  Be default this parameter is set to "localhost:8086".
  
  

**User**

  Defines the InfluxDB username to use. If this name is left empty
  credentials are assumed to be disabled.
  Be default this parameter is set to "".
  
  

**Password**

  Defines the password to be used for the set User.
  Be default this parameter is set to "".
  
  

**Database**

  Sets the InfluxDB database to write to.
  Be default this parameter is set to "default".
  
  

**TimeBasedName**

  Enables time based of databse names and rotation.
  When setting this parameter to true the Database parameter is treated as a
  template for time.Format, i.e. you can use "default-2006-01-02" to switch
  databases each day.
  By default this parameter is set to "true".
  
  

**RetentionPolicy**

  Only avaialble for Version 90. This setting defines the
  InfluxDB retention policy allowed with this protocol version.
  By default this parameter is set to "".
  
  

Parameters (from BatchedProducer)
---------------------------------

**Batch/MaxCount** (default: 8192)

  Defines the maximum number of messages per batch. If this
  limit is reached a flush is always triggered.
  By default this parameter is set to 8192.
  
  

**Batch/FlushCount** (default: 4096)

  Defines the minimum number of messages required to flush
  a batch. If this limit is reached a flush might be triggered.
  By default this parameter is set to 4096.
  
  

**Batch/TimeoutSec** (default: 5, unit: sec)

  Defines the maximum time in seconds messages can stay in
  the internal buffer before being flushed.
  By default this parameter is set to 5.
  
  

Parameters (from DirectProducer)
--------------------------------

**Enable**

  switches the consumer on or off. By default this value is set to true.
  
  

**ID**

  allows this producer to be found by other plugins by name. By default this
  is set to "" which does not register this producer.
  
  

**ShutdownTimeoutMs**

  sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect
  a blocking producer during shutdown. By default this is set to 1 second.
  Decreasing this value may lead to lost messages during shutdown. Increasing
  this value will increase shutdown time.
  
  

**Streams**

  contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the
  message channels this producer will consume. By default this is set to "*"
  which means "listen to all routers but the internal".
  
  

**FallbackStream**

  defines the stream used for messages that are sent to the fallback after
  a timeout (see ChannelTimeoutMs). By default this is _DROPPED_.
  
  

**Modulators**

  sets formatter and filter to use. Each formatter has its own set of options
  which can be set here, too. By default this is set to format.Forward.
  Each producer decides if and when to use a Formatter.
