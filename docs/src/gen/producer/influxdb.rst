InfluxDB
========

This producer writes data to an influxDB cluster.
The data is expected to be of a valid influxDB format.
As the data format changed between influxDB versions it is advisable to use a formatter for the specific influxDB version you want to write to.
There are collectd to influxDB formatters available that can be used (as an example).


Parameters
----------

**Enable**
  Enable switches the consumer on or off.
  By default this value is set to true.

**ID**
  ID allows this producer to be found by other plugins by name.
  By default this is set to "" which does not register this producer.

**Channel**
  Channel sets the size of the channel used to communicate messages.
  By default this value is set to 8192.

**ChannelTimeoutMs**
  ChannelTimeoutMs sets a timeout in milliseconds for messages to wait if this producer's queue is full.
  A timeout of -1 or lower will drop the message without notice.
  A timeout of 0 will block until the queue is free.
  This is the default.
  A timeout of 1 or higher will wait x milliseconds for the queues to become available again.
  If this does not happen, the message will be send to the retry channel.

**ShutdownTimeoutMs**
  ShutdownTimeoutMs sets a timeout in milliseconds that will be used to detect a blocking producer during shutdown.
  By default this is set to 3 seconds.
  If processing a message takes longer to process than this duration, messages will be dropped during shutdown.

**Stream**
  Stream contains either a single string or a list of strings defining the message channels this producer will consume.
  By default this is set to "*" which means "listen to all streams but the internal".

**DropToStream**
  DropToStream defines the stream used for messages that are dropped after a timeout (see ChannelTimeoutMs).
  By default this is _DROPPED_.

**Formatter**
  Formatter sets a formatter to use.
  Each formatter has its own set of options which can be set here, too.
  By default this is set to format.Forward.
  Each producer decides if and when to use a Formatter.

**Filter**
  Filter sets a filter that is applied before formatting, i.e. before a message is send to the message queue.
  If a producer requires filtering after formatting it has to define a separate filter as the producer decides if and where to format.

**Host**
  Host defines the host (and port) of the InfluxDB server.
  Defaults to "localhost:8086".

**User**
  User defines the InfluxDB username to use to login.
  If this name is left empty credentials are assumed to be disabled.
  Defaults to empty.

**Password**
  Password defines the user's password.
  Defaults to empty.

**Database**
  Database sets the InfluxDB database to write to.
  By default this is is set to "default".

**TimeBasedName**
  TimeBasedName enables using time.Format based formatting of databse names.
  I.e. you can use something like "metrics-2006-01-02" to switch databases for each day.
  This setting is enabled by default.

**RetentionPolicy**
  RetentionPolicy correlates to the InfluxDB retention policy setting.
  This is left empty by default (no retention policy used).

**UseVersion08**
  UseVersion08 has to be set to true when writing data to InfluxDB 0.8.x.
  By default this is set to false.
  DEPRECATED.
  Use Version instead.

**Version**
  Version defines the InfluxDB version to use as in Mmp (Major, minor, patch).
  For version 0.8.x use 80, for version 0.9.0 use 90, for version 1.0.0 use use 100 and so on.
  Defaults to 100.

**BatchMaxCount**
  BatchMaxCount defines the maximum number of messages that can be buffered before a flush is mandatory.
  If the buffer is full and a flush is still underway or cannot be triggered out of other reasons, the producer will block.
  By default this is set to 8192.

**BatchFlushCount**
  BatchFlushCount defines the number of messages to be buffered before they are written to InfluxDB.
  This setting is clamped to BatchMaxCount.
  By default this is set to BatchMaxCount / 2.

**BatchTimeoutSec**
  BatchTimeoutSec defines the maximum number of seconds to wait after the last message arrived before a batch is flushed automatically.
  By default this is set to 5.
