HTTPRequest
===========

The HTTPRequest producer sends messages as HTTP requests to a given webserver.

In RawData mode, incoming messages are expected to contain complete
HTTP requests in "wire format", such as:
::

  POST /foo/bar HTTP/1.0\n
  Content-type: text/plain\n
  Content-length: 24
  \n
  Dummy test\n
  Request data\n

In this mode, the message's contents is parsed as an HTTP request and
sent to the destination server (virtually) unchanged. If the message
cannot be parsed as an HTTP request, an error is logged. Only the scheme,
host and port components of the "Address" URL are used; any path and query
parameters are ignored. The "Encoding" parameter is ignored.

If RawData mode is off, a POST request is made to the destination server
for each incoming message, using the complete URL in "Address". The
incoming message's contents are delivered in the POST request's body
and Content-type is set to the value of "Encoding"




Parameters
----------

**Enable** (default: true)

  Switches this plugin on or off.
  

**Address**

  defines the URL to send http requests to. If the value doesn't
  contain "://",  it is prepended with "http://", so short forms like
  "localhost:8088" are accepted. The default value is "http://localhost:80".
  
  

**RawData** (default: true)

  Turns "RawData" mode on. See the description above.
  
  

**Encoding** (default: text/plain; charset=utf-8)

  Defines the payload encoding when RawData is set to false.
  
  

Parameters (from core.BufferedProducer)
---------------------------------------

**Channel**

  This value defines the capacity of the message buffer.
  By default this parameter is set to "8192".
  
  

**ChannelTimeoutMs** (default: 0, unit: ms)

  This value defines a timeout for each message
  before the message will discarded. To disable the timeout, set this
  parameter to 0.
  By default this parameter is set to "0".
