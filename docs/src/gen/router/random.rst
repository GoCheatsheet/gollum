Random
======

The "Random" router relays each message sent to the stream [Stream] to
exactly one of the producers connected to [Stream]. The receiving producer
is chosen randomly for each message.

Configuration example:

# Generate junk
JunkGenerator:
  Type: "consumer.Profiler"
  Message: "%20s"
  Streams: "junkstream"
  Characters: "abcdefghijklmZ"
  KeepRunning: true
  Runs: 10000
  Batches: 3000000
  DelayMs: 500
# Randomly assign messages to connected producers
JunkRouterRand:
  Type: "router.Random"
  Stream: "junkstream"
# Produce messages to stdout
JunkPrinter00:
  Type: "producer.Console"
  Streams: "junkstream"
  Modulators:
    - "format.Envelope":
        Prefix: "[junk_00] "
# Produce messages to stdout
JunkPrinter01:
  Type: "producer.Console"
  Streams: "junkstream"
  Modulators:
    - "format.Envelope":
        Prefix: "[junk_01] "
