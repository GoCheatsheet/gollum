RoundRobin
==========

This router implements round robin routing. Messages will always be routed to
only and exactly one of the producers registered to the given stream. The
producer is switched in a round robin fashin after each message.
This producer can be useful for load balancing, e.g. when the target service
does not support sharding by itself.
