RoundRobin
==========

Messages will be sent to one of the producers attached to this router.
Producers will be switched one-by-one.

The "RoundRobin" router relays each message sent to the stream [Stream] to
exactly one of the producers connected to [Stream]. The producer is selected
by rotating the connected producers in sequence, one producer per received
message.

Configuration example:

# Generate junk
JunkGenerator:
  Type: "consumer.Profiler"
  Message: "%20s"
  Streams: "junkstream"
  Characters: "abcdefghijklmZ"
  KeepRunning: true
  Runs: 10000
  Batches: 3000000
  DelayMs: 500
# Spread messages to connected producers in round-robin
JunkRouterRoundRob:
  Type: "router.RoundRobin"
  Stream: "junkstream"
# Produce messages to stdout
JunkPrinter00:
  Type: "producer.Console"
  Streams: "junkstream"
  Modulators:
    - "format.Envelope":
        Prefix: "[junk_00] "
# Produce messages to stdout
JunkPrinter01:
  Type: "producer.Console"
  Streams: "junkstream"
  Modulators:
    - "format.Envelope":
        Prefix: "[junk_01] "
