Broadcast
=========

The "Broadcast" plugin relays all messages sent to [Stream]  to all
produces connected to [Stream].

With the default options, this plugin has no practical effect. Using
the Filters and TimeoutMs options, it is possible to restrict and control
the messages being passed.

Configuration example:

# Generate junk messages
JunkGenerator:
  Type: "consumer.Profiler"
  Message: "%20s"
  Streams: "junkstream"
  Characters: "abcdefghijklmZ"
  KeepRunning: true
  Runs: 10000
  Batches: 3000000
  DelayMs: 500
# Filter out messsages including 'Z' and broadcast them
JunkRouterBroad:
  Type: "router.Broadcast"
  Stream: "junkstream"
  Filters:
    - JunkRegexp:
        Type: "filter.RegExp"
        Expression: "Z"
# Produce filtered messages from 'junkstream' to stdout
JunkPrinter00:
  Type: "producer.Console"
  Streams: "junkstream"
  Modulators:
    - "format.Envelope":
        Prefix: "[junkdist_00] "
# Produce filtered messages from 'junkstream' to stdout
JunkPrinter01:
  Type: "producer.Console"
  Streams: "junkstream"
  Modulators:
    - "format.Envelope":
        Prefix: "[junkdist_01] "
