Distribute
==========================================================================

Messages will be routed to all routers configured.
Each target stream can hold another stream configuration, too, so this is not directly sending to the producers attached to the target routers.


Parameters
----------

**Routes**
  Routes defines a 1:n stream remapping.
  Messages are reassigned to all of stream(s) in this list.
  If no route is set messages are forwarded on the incoming router.
  When routing to multiple routers, the incoming stream has to be listed explicitly to be used.

Example
-------

.. code-block:: yaml

	"myrouter":
	    Type: "router.Distribute"
	    Stream: "mystream"
	    TargetStreams:
	        - "foo"
	        - "bar"
