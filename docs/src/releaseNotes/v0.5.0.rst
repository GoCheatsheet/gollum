v0.5.0
==================================

Breaking changes 0.4.x to 0.5.0
--------------------------------


Configuration
`````````````

The goal of this breaking change was to make Gollum configuration files
easier to maintain and easier to merge. In addition to that several
quirks and inconsistencies have been resolved.

Plugin header
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| This change allows configs to be easier to merge which is requirement
  for future features.
| As of this change a new, mandatory field “Type” has been added.

**From**

.. code:: yaml

    - "plugin.Type":
        ID: "pluginId"

**To**

.. code:: yaml

    "pluginId":
        Type: "plugin.Type"

Plural form and case sensitivity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In previous versions fields did not follow a rule when to use plural or
singular. In 0.5.0 plural means “one or more values” while singular
means “only one value”. In addition to that all names are now case
insensitive.

**From**

.. code:: yaml

    - "plugin.Type":
        ID: "pluginId"
        Category:
            - "Foo"
            - "Bar"
        Streams:
            - "foo"
            - "bar"

**To**

.. code:: yaml

    "pluginId":
        type: "plugin.Type"
        categories:
            - "Foo"
            - "Bar"
        streams:
            - "foo"
            - "bar"

Formatters and filters are now modulators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In earlier versions chaining formatters was done by nesting them via
options. This was confusing as the order was “upside down”. In addition
to that you could use every formatter only once. The new modulator
concept introduces a more natural order and allows formatters to be
reused as often as necessary. In addition to that, filter and formatters
have been merged into the same list. This fixes the problem of applying
filters before or after formatters that was previously fixed by adding
e.g. a “FilterAfterFormat” field.

**From**

.. code:: yaml

    - "plugin.Type":
        ID: "pluginId"
        Filter: "filter.Before"
        FilterAfterFormat: "filter.After"
        Formatter: "format.SECOND"
        SECONDOption: "foobar"
        SECONDFormatter: "format.FIRST"

**To**

.. code:: yaml

    "pluginId":
        Type: "plugin.Type"
        Modulators:
            - "filter.Before"
            - "format.FIRST"
            - "format.SECOND"
                Option: "foobar"
            - "filter.After"

Nested options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some plugins had a set of options starting with the same prefix
(e.g. file.Producer). These options have now been grouped.

**From**

.. code:: yaml

    - "plugin.Type":
        ID: "pluginId"
        RotateAfterHours: 10
        RotateSizeMB: 1024
        RotateAt: "00:00"

**To**

.. code:: yaml

    "pluginId":
        Type: "plugin.Type"
        Rotate:
            AfterHours: 10
            SizeMB: 1024
            At: "00:00"

Plugins
`````````````

| The plugin system has been refactored to make plugins more consistent
  and to reduce the amount of work required to write a new plugin. This
  change introduced new subclasses and changed some of the basic
  interfaces.
| The shutdown process has been revamped to give plugins a better chance
  to cleanly shut down and to get rid of all their messages without the
  system having to care about stream loops.

Renaming of streams to routers
``````````````````````````````

| A “stream” in 0.4.x has a double meaning. It denotes a stream of data,
  as well as a type of plugin that is used to route messages from one
  stream to another or simply to configure a certain stream of data in
  terms of formatting.
| To make it easier to talk about these to things the
  routing/configuring part (the plugins) are renamed to “router”.

**From**

.. code:: yaml

    - "stream.Broadcast":
        ID: "Splitter"
        Stream: "foo"

**To**

.. code:: yaml

    "Splitter":
        Type: "router.Broadcast"
        Stream: "foo"

Removal of gollum/shared
``````````````````````````

All types from the ``github.com/trivago/gollum/shared`` package have
been moved to the new ``github.com/trivago/tgo`` package and
subpackages. This allows us to re-use these types in other projects more
easily and introduces a better structure. This package is meant to be an
extension to the Golang standard library and follows a “t-prefix” naming
convention. Everything that you would expect in e.g. the ``sync``
package will be placed in ``tgo/tsync``.

**From**

.. code:: go

    c := shared.MaxI(a,b)
    spin := shared.NewSpinner(shared.SpinPriorityLow)

**To**

.. code:: go

    c := tmath.MaxI(a,b)
    spin := tsync.NewSpinner(tsync.SpinPriorityLow)

Base classes
`````````````

In version 0.4.x and earlier not all plugins had a base class. In 0.5.0
all plugins have base classes and existing base classes have been
renamed.

**renamed**

::

    core.ConsumerBase -> core.SimpleConsumer
    core.ProducerBase -> core.BufferedProducer
    core.StreamBase   -> core.SimpleRouter

**new**

::

    core.SimpleConsumer     Consumer base class
    core.SimpleFilter       Filter base class
    core.SimpleFormatter    Formatter base class
    core.SimpleProducer     Producer base class
    core.SimpleRouter       Router base class
    core.DirectProducer     A producer that directly accepts messages without buffering
    core.BufferedProducer   A producer that reads messages from a channel
    core.BatchedProducer    A producer that collects messages and processes them in a batch

Metrics
`````````````

| Metrics have been moved from gollum/shared to the tgo package. As of
  this ``shared.Metric.*`` has to be replaced by ``tgo.Metric.*`` and
  the package “github.com/trivago/tgo” has to be imported instead of
  “github.com/trivago/gollum/shared”.
| Please note that “per second” metrics can now be added without
  additional overhead by using
  ``tgo.Metric.NewRate(metricName, rateMetricName, time.Second, 10, 3, true)``.
  All custom “per second” metrics should be replaced with this function.

Logging
`````````````

Version 0.5.0 introduces logrus based scoped logging to give error
messages a clearer context. As of this every plugin has a “Logger”
member in its base class.

**From**

.. code:: go

    Log.Error.Print("MyPlugin: Something's wrong", err)

**To**

.. code:: go

    plugin.Logger.WithError(err).Error("Something's wrong")

Configure
`````````````

Error handling has been improved so that a plugin automatically reacts
on missing or invalid values. Errors are now collected in a stack
attached to the config reader and processed as a batch after configure
returns. In addition to that, simple types can now be configured using
struct tags.

**From**

.. code:: go

    type Console struct {
        core.ConsumerBase
        autoExit bool
        pipeName string
        pipePerm uint32
        pipe     *os.File
    }

    func (cons *Console) Configure(conf core.PluginConfig) error {
        cons.autoexit = conf.GetBool("ExitOnEOF", true)
        inputConsole := conf.GetString("Console", "stdin")

        switch strings.ToLower(inputConsole) {
        case "stdin":
            cons.pipe = os.Stdin
            cons.pipeName = "stdin"
        case "stdin":
            return fmt.Errorf("Cannot read from stderr")
        default:
            cons.pipe = nil
            cons.pipeName = inputConsole

            if perm, err := strconv.ParseInt(conf.GetString("Permissions", "0664"), 8, 32); err != nil {
                Log.Error.Printf("Error parsing named pipe permissions: %s", err)
            } else {
                cons.pipePerm = uint32(perm)
            }
        }

        return cons.ConsumerBase.Configure(conf)
    }

**To**

.. code:: go

    type Console struct {
        core.SimpleConsumer
        autoExit            bool   `config:"ExitOnEOF" default:"true"`
        pipeName            string `config:"Pipe" default:"stdin"`
        pipePerm            uint32 `config:"Permissions" default:"0644"`
        pipe                *os.File
    }

    func (cons *Console) Configure(conf core.PluginConfigReader) {
        switch strings.ToLower(cons.pipeName) {
        case "stdin":
            cons.pipe = os.Stdin
            cons.pipeName = "stdin"
        case "stderr":
            conf.Errors.Pushf("Cannot read from stderr")
        default:
            cons.pipe = nil
        }
    }
